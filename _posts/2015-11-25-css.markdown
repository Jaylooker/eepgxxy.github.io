CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet and it targets the styling of the Web.

CSS is used to style the page. With CSS, you can have different colors, different shapes, different shadows, different font styles, etc. With CSS, what limits how you design the page is not your CSS skills but your imaginations.


Some key points of CSS:

* Always put the CSS rules in a .css file and link it in the HTML page.
* Pay attention to the cascading weight of different rules.
* Practise, practise and practise to be a CSS guru.

A typical example code of CSS:

{% highlight css %}
div {
	width: 200px;
	height: 200px;
	color: #f00;
	background-color: #0f0;
	margin: 0 auto;
}
#=> make a green div with the size of 200 * 200 centered in the page
{% endhighlight %}
