SQL stands for **Structured Query Langauge**. It is the standardized programming language for **relational databases**. 

In order to learn relational databases, you need to learn **SQL** first. The most basic SQL commands are **CRUD** which stands for **Create**, **Read**, **Update** and **Delete**.

+ :bell: The typical CREATE commands examples:
	* {% highlight sql %}CREATE DATABASE test{% endhighlight %}  >create a database named `test`
    * {% highlight sql %}CREATE TABLE one (id INT, name VARCHAR(20), age INT, gender CHAR(1)){% endhighlight %} >create a table
    * {% highlight sql %}CREATE USER 'xiaoming'@'localhost' identified by '123' {% endhighlight %}>create a new user and password
    
+ :bell: The typical READ commands examples:
    * {% highlight sql %}SELECT * FROM one{% endhighlight %} >select everything from table `one`
    * {% highlight sql %}SELECT * FROM one ORDER BY id DESC{% endhighlight %} >select everything from table `one` by descending order
    * {% highlight sql %}SELECT * FROM one WHERE id = 1{% endhighlight %} >select the record whose id is `1` from table `one`
    * {% highlight sql %}SELECT * FROM one WHERE name LIKE 'xi%'{% endhighlight %} >select the records whose name begins with `xi` from table `one`
    
+ :bell: The typical UPDATE command example:
    * {% highlight sql %}UPDATE one SET name = 'xiaohong' WHERE id = 1{% endhighlight %} >change the name of the record with id `1` to `xiaohong` 
    
+ :bell: The typical DELETE commands examples:
    * {% highlight sql %}DELETE * FROM one{% endhighlight %} >delete everything from table `one`
    * {% highlight sql %}DELETE * FROM one WHERE id =2 {% endhighlight %} >delete the record with id = 2 from table `one`

The above :point_up: basic *SQL* commands are fundamental commands and are the basics for programming database web pages and applications.

There are plenty of SQL books :books: out there. You can just grab one and it should serve your needs.
