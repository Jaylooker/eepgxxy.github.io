Coding colors is probably one of the most common tasks that you will do when styling a web page using CSS. There are different ways to code a color in CSS. Normally there are four ways and they are best suited to different scenarios.

* Coding colors in CSS using **color names**:

This is the most intuitive way to represent a color in CSS - just use the color names. In this way, "red" is red, "blue" is blue, and so on and so forth. However, there are limitations to this method. In CSS, we only have 
140 color names up to the standard of CSS3. The advantage of this method is also very obvious: more intuitive and easier to remember. 

{% highlight css %}
 #name {
   color: red;
 }
{% endhighlight %}

* Coding colors in CSS using **hexadecimal values**:

This is probably the most browser compatible way to code a color in CSS. There are 255*255*255 different colors by this method, enough for us to use. Limitations are not so easy to remember and to code a known color. Usually we need some software tools to help us to design a color using hexademical codes. Color picker softwares will be a help.

{% highlight css %}
  #name {
    color: #f00;
 }
{% endhighlight %}

* Coding colors in CSS using **RGB values**:

This is just a different representation form to the hexadecimal values. Each of the RGB color is represented by an integer number between 0 and 255 or an float number between 0% and 100%. It is a good method to use if you know very well how to design a color by mixing different amount of *red*, *green* and *blue*. You can also have a fourth value *Alpha* for the transparency control of the colors as a plus compared to the hexadecimal color codes.

{% highlight css %}
  #name {
    color: #rgb(255, 0, 0);
 }
{% endhighlight %}

* Coding colors in CSS using **HSL codes**:

I would say this is the both intuitive and comprehensive way to code a color in CSS. **H** is for *hue* and the value is between 0 and 360, other values are allowed but will be recomputed by module 360. **S** stands for *saturation* and the value is between 0% and 100%. **L** stands for *lightness* and the value is also between 0% and 100%. Like *rgba*, *hsla* also adds the value for *alpha channel* to the color. Although *hsl* is an intuitive way to code color in CSS, it is not widely used as the other color coding methods. My guess is that most of the front-end developers are not very professional at using image processing softwares such as *photoshop* before diving into CSS coding. And in image processing softwares *hsl* is being widely used.

{% highlight css %}
  #name {
    color: #hsl(0, 100%, 50%);
 }
{% endhighlight %}

You can use either of the four different ways to code a color in CSS and the decision is mostly based on which color method is already used in the project.:smirk:
