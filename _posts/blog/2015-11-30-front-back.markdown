As a web developer, you will be either working as a **front-end** developer or a **back-end** developer, and sometimes as a **fullstack** developer.

Front-end technology usually refers to HTML, CSS, JavaScript (can also be used for back-end) and the other technologies that sit between the user and back-end. While back-end technology usually refers to server-side technologies such as Servlet, JSP, ASP, PHP, etc. Fullstack usually includes both front-end and back-end.

Although UI design is often seperately considered when talking about the Web technology, it is a non-trivial part of the process of web design. The following diagram shows the non-complete part of the different aspects of web technologies :point_down::

In the course you will be trained to be a fullstack web developer, so stay tuned! :running:
