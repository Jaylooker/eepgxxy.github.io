HTML stands for **Hyper Text Markup Language** and it serves the base of the Web.

HTML (somethimes together with CSS and Javascript) tells how to display the information in the web to the end users.

The following figure shows some of the HTML semantic tags :point_down::

Some key points of HTML:

* :bell: HTML is supposed to act as the skeleton of the web page.
* :bell: HTML should be used according to their semantic meanings.
* :bell: Styling the page should not be the purpose of HTML.

A typical example skeleton code of HTML:

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>example code of HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Hello world</h1>
</body>
</html>
#=> prints 'Hello world'.
{% endhighlight %}
