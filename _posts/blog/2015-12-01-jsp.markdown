JSP is designed for the less java-capable web developers to be used as a web **server side** programming language.

However, I would argue that knowing java well still makes your jsp programming life much easier.
Since we have already have Servlet in our programming tool box, why do we need JSP? Well, JSP
makes programming easier compared to Servlet especially for the developers coming from the
front-end side. The differences between JSP and Servlet can be summarized as follows:

* JSP is java being contained in HTML file
* Servlet is HTML being contained in Java file

To further illustrate this, let's have a look at the following simple JSP example code:

{% highlight jsp %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>example code of HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
	<%
	out.println("<h1>Hello world</h1>");
	%>
</body>
</html>
#=> prints 'Hello world'.
{% endhighlight %}

Although JSP and Servlet are different on the superficial side, they are the same thing inside the web server engine. When you put the above example code inside a file called `example.jsp` and put the file inside the `root` folder of `webapps` in the tomcat home directory,  visiting the `example.jsp` file using a browser will produce a file called `example_jsp.java` and a file called `example_jsp.class` under the `work` folder of the tomcat home directory.The two auto-produced files reveals the fact that JSP and Servlet are both java classes in the final stage of the web server processing.
