**Database** is almost a must-have component in dynamic web pages or applications. And this time I am focusing on the connecting to database from **JSP** using **JDBC**.

JDBC stands for **Java DataBase Connectivity**. JDBC is the Java API for connection to relational databases. In order to connect to the relational database from the **JSP** page, the JDBC driver must be first installed in the right place. I am illustrating this using both the *plain* way and the *IDE* way for connecting to the *MySQL* database.

For the *plain* way, I first put the **JDBC** driver `mysql-connector-java-x.x.xx-bin.jar` in the `lib` folder of the *tomcat* home directory and put a *JSP* file in the `webapps` folder. The *JSP* file is as follows :point_down::

{% highlight jsp %}
<%@page import="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" %>
<%@page import="java.sql.*" %>
<%
    Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
    Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test", "root", "");
    Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
    try {
    final String sql = "SELECT * FROM one";
    ResultSet result = stmt.executeQuery(sql);
    while(result.next()) {
        out.println(result.getString(1));
        out.println(result.getString(2));
        out.println(result.getString(3));
    }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        out.println(e.getMessage());
}
    result.close();
    stmt.close();
    conn.close();
%>
{% endhighlight %}

In this way, the *JSP* file outputs all the records in the `one` table of the `test` database.

For the *IDE* way, I am using *Netbeans* and simply removing the code
{% highlight jsp %}
<%@page import="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" %>
{% endhighlight %}and
{% highlight jsp %}
Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
{% endhighlight %} 
for the *JSP* file, as *Netbeans* already has the **JDBC** driver included.

The two ways above :point_up: are slightly different. However, they both follow the same flow chart as follows :point_down: :
