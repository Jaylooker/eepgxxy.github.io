I am sure that all of you are thinking about the final test at this moment. So here are some of the notes to the final test for the autumn semester course. 

The final score is based on the final test and the performances for the class attendence (plus in-class project assignments), *50%* each. You will get a score of either `A` or `B` or `C` or `D` or `F` (in extreme cases).

The final test is also in the form of a in-class project assignment just as what you did in the project classes during the semester. The difference is that you are only required to choose **one** from the five different assignment topics. The scoring of the final test is based on the following criteria :point_down::

* :bell: How much percent of the requirements for the topic you have finished and how well you do.
* :bell: How long it takes for you to finish the assignment. The sooner you finish, the higher your score will be.
* :bell: To get an `A` you have to finish it within *two* hours and to get a `B` you have to finish it within *two and half* hours.
* :bell: Which assignment topic you choose. For each topic, we have a quota system based on the number of the students in the class. As a result, the quota for `A` is :two:, for `B` is also :two:. There are no quota for `C`, `D` and `F`. 

So please prepare carefully and choose wisely!:dart:
