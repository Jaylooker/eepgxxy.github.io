This is the course I am currently teaching in `School of Information and Electronic Engineering` in `Zhejiang Gongshang University` for the autumn semester. 

This course introduces the fantastic technologies behind 'Web' which we are using almost everyday. Within the vast technologies of Web, this course focuses on the basics of `HTML`, `CSS`, `Javascript`, `Servlet`, `JSP` and `MySQL`. As a fundemental course for the college students and others who are interested, this course guides you step by step to the `know-hows` behind the web. This course also serves as a preliminary one for another advanced web technology course which I teach in the spring semester. Please read my frequently updated posts and enjoy learning :wink:.
